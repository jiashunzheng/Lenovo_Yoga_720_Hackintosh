# Lenovo Yoga 720 15IKB
This is a working configuration of my Hackintosh build on Yoga 720 running 10.15.6. 

Wifi: BCM94360NG (native support).

## If you plan to use this configuration, make sure you use GenSMBIOS to generate your own model/serial numbers and put them in config.plist

## This configuration required your CFG is unlocked, if not please enable AppleCpuPmCfgLock and AppleXcpmCfgLock in the config.plist, as shown here:
